configuration:
  airplay_name:
    name: Airplay Name
    description: >-
      The Name that will show up on your iOS device. 
  offset:
    name: Playback offset
    description: >-
      Can be used to adjust syncing issues, can also be set to negative values.
  interpolation:
    name: Interpolation
    description: >-
      Should be left on "auto", you can choose "soxr" if you have a fast processor (otherwise, the CPU will be overloaded and there might be problems with the buffer, so no sound or dropouts). "soxr" might not work on ARM processors.
  enabled:
    name: Enable MQTT
    description: >-
      Set to "no" to disable MQTT, and to "yes" to enable it.
  mqtt_host:
    name: MQTT host
    description: >-
      IP or hostname of the MQTT host (127.0.0.1 should work in most cases)
  mqtt_publish_cover:
    name: MQTT publish cover
    description: >-
      When set to yes, it allows MQTT to transmit the cover (might lead to more load on the MQTT broker)
  output_backend:
    name: Output Backend
    description: >-
      Should be left on "pa", otherwise audio usually wont work.
  default_airplay_volume:
    name: Default Airplay Volume
    description: >-
      Will set the standard volume for a new session (if the last session was loud). Default is "-24.0"
  volume_max_db:
    name: Maximum Volume
    description: >-
      Must have a decimal point in it, to set the maximum volume [in dB]. E.g. "-10.0". Default is "0.0". 
      The setting must be in the mixers range (0.0 to -96.2 for the standard software mixer). 
      If you choose the hardware mixer (below) the range is untested (0.0 to -??.?)
  output_format:
    name: Output Bit Depth Format
    description: >-
      Default is "auto" which uses 16 bit (and the endianness matching that of your processor)
      Can also be "U8", "S8", "S16", "S16_LE", "S16_BE", "S24", "S24_LE", "S24_BE", "S24_3LE", "S24_3BE", "S32", "S32_LE" or "S32_BE" but the device must have the the capability to process it.
      If you are using software volume control and can take advantage of 24-bit or 32-bit DACs. Dithering can occur on a larger sample, making the noise floor very much lower.
  output_rate:
    name: Output Sampling Rate
    description: >-
      Default is "auto" which uses 44100 hz
      Can also be multiples of 44100 which means 88200, 176400 or 352800, but the output device must have the capability to process it.
      This is done using simple sample replication and without interpolation.
      Untested (and probably impossible or interpolated) are 48000, 96000 and 192000
  use_precision_timing:
    name: Precision timing
    description: >-
      Use this optional advanced setting to control how Shairport Sync gathers timing information.
      Default is "auto". If the output device is a real hardware device, precision timing will be used.
      Choose "no" for more compatible standard timing, choose "yes" to force the use of precision timing, which may cause problems.
  disable_standby_mode:
    name: Disable Standby Mode
    description: >-
      Default is "never", but only for backwards compatibility.
      Setting "always" prevents the DAC from entering the standby mode.
      Setting "auto" prevents standby mode while music is playing (shairport-sync is active). 
  high_threshold_airplay_volume:
    name: Loud Volume Threshold
    description: >-
      Airplay volume greater or equal to this is "very loud". 
      If you are below this Threshold, it will remember the last volume setting and reapply it to the next session.
      If you listened to a very loud volume last time, it will fall back to the Default Airplay Volume in the next session.
  mixer_control_name:
    name: Mixer control name
    description: >-
      The name of the mixer to use to adjust output volume. Default "Headphone". If not specified, no mixer is used and volume in adjusted in software.
      If you use a USB DAC you probably want to use "PCM" to enable the hardware mixer for volume control.
  mixer_control_index:
    name: Output Device Index (Mixer control)
    description: >-
      Default "0". If you have only one Audio device in your machine this will probably be on index "0".
      If you use an additional device (e.g. a USB-DAC) it might be on index "1". You can check the index in in the Terminal using "ha audio info".
  volume_control_combined_hardware_priority:
    name: Prioritize Hardware Volume Control
    description: >-
      Default is "no", which will only use (lossy) software volume control. 
      Setting "yes" will extend the volume range by combining the hardware mixer (used first) with the software mixer (used later).
  drift_tolerance_in_seconds:
    name: Drift Tolerance
    description:  >-
      Default is "0.002" seconds.
      Alow a timing error of this number of seconds of drift away from exact synchronisation before attempting to correct it
  resync_threshold_in_seconds:
    name: Resync Threshold
    description:  >-
      Default is "0.050" seconds
      A synchronisation error greater than this number of seconds will cause resynchronisation; 0.0 disables it
  resync_recovery_time_in_seconds:
    name: Resync Recovery Time
    description: >-
      Default is "0.100" seconds
      Allow this extra time to recover after a late resync. Increase the value, possibly to 0.5, in a virtual machine.
  audio_backend_buffer_desired_length_in_seconds:
    name: Buffer Length
    description: >-
      Default is 0.2 seconds in the alsa backend, 0.35 seconds in the pa backend and 1.0 seconds otherwise.
      If set too small, buffer underflow occurs on low-powered machines. Too long and the response time to volume changes becomes annoying.
